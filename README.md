# Kodify React Technical Test

This is the repository where my Kodify Technical Test resides.

In order to fullfil the technical test requirements, there will be a client side ( created with React-Create-App) and a simple NodeJS server.

The client side react app resides on client folder and the NodeJS server on the server folder.

# How-to Run

Checkout code & run docker-compose up.

# More info

There is a Changelog.md that I was updating while I was doing this exam, explaining a bit of my toughts along the way.
