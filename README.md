# Kodify React Technical Test

This is the repository where my Kodify Technical Test resides

In order to fullfil the technical test requirements, there will be a client side ( created with React-Create-App) and a simple NodeJS server.

The client side resides on client folder and the NodeJS server on the server folder.

# First Merge to Master 

At this point, the basic functionality is working except for the beautification of the component rendering.

Will handle this now.
