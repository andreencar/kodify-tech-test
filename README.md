# Kodify React Technical Test

This is the repository where my Kodify Technical Test resides.

In order to fullfil the technical test requirements, there will be a client side ( created with React-Create-App) and a simple NodeJS server.

The client side react app resides on client folder and the NodeJS server on the server folder.

# How-to Run

Checkout code & run docker-compose up. Website should be accessible at http://localhost.

# More info

There is a Changelog.md that I was updating while I was doing this exam, explaining a bit of my toughts along the way.

Only did one test on MessageService as an example on which class to focus on to test the separated business logic. The technical test did not require it but seemed appropriate to showcase.
